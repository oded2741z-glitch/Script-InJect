Script Inject - The AI-to-Code Workflow Accelerator

Short Description:
A lightweight utility designed to instantly inject code from your clipboard into a Python script and execute it immediately. The perfect bridge between AI Chatbots and your local environment.

Full Description:
Stop wasting time manually pasting code.

Script Inject is a dedicated productivity tool built for developers who frequently use AI (like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini) to generate Python scripts. Instead of opening an IDE, pasting, saving, and running manually—Script Inject does it all in one split second.

How it works:

Drag & Drop any target file (e.g., main.py or even a .txt file) into the window.

Copy code from your browser while holding Shift (Global Hotkey).

Done. The file is updated instantly, and you can run it immediately.

It serves as a "bridge" between your browser and your local environment, making prototyping faster than ever.

Key Features:

🚀 Instant Injection: Overwrite your target file directly from the clipboard using Shift+Copy.

⚡ One-Key Execution: Run your script instantly with the R key or the Run button.

💻 CMD Integration: Instantly open a Command Prompt in the file's directory and execute the script automatically—perfect for viewing error logs and debugging.

📦 One-Click Build: Compile your Python script into a standalone EXE using a built-in PyInstaller wrapper (Auto-detects icon.ico).

🔄 Auto-Convert: Dragging a .txt file automatically renames it to .py for immediate use.

👻 Ghost Mode: Use F4 to instantly toggle the window's visibility and focus.

🛡️ Safe Mode: Toggle injection on/off with a checkbox to prevent accidental overwrites.

🎨 Dark Mode UI: Minimalist, developer-friendly interface that stays out of your way.

System Requirements:

OS: Windows 10 / 11

Python (Required only for running scripts and building EXEs)

Recommended libraries: pip install pyinstaller pyperclip keyboard tkinterdnd2
